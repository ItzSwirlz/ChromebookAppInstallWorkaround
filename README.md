# ChromebookAppInstallWorkaround
A workaround on Chrome OS to install Applications outside of a specific group of applications allowed for the user to install through the browser. For my school

---
When an organization restricts a user from installing apps, except for specific ones whitelisted for them, it is impossible to install any other extensions/apps. A popup window says the school district blocks it.

However, when you go to a website that has an app, it will offer you to install said app.

You can install the app, totally bypassing the Chrome Web Store's function to block a user from installing the application under an organization under the whitelist.

This is convenient for the user, so there is nothing really bad against it. Apps that are blocked websites will still be blocked as it is just a chrome browser, strapped inside of an application.
# FIXME: Example screenshots

# Websites that I know that have apps
* Any google sites
* vscode.dev - Visual Studio Code's online IDE
* cstimer.net - Speedcube Timer

^ these sites all have applications the end user cannot install through the Chrome Web Store, but can via accessing the site as the browser will let them install it


# Impact/Significance
Any blocked websites will still show any firewalls on the site being blocked; the only 'threat' is more customizable applications, making it easy for the enduser to access a website.
